Movie Suggester web application uses the TMDB API to get movie data to make recommendations to the user. The recommendations are based on the users input and selections in the form shown upon loading the page. Filter options include similar movie title, keywords, genres, and cast members. On submission of the form, a carousel of movie cards appears that the user can click through. The user can then flip each card with the movie poster to reveal each movie's details.
